Input Algorithms
================

This is a library that exists to validate and normalise structured data. It is
a requirement of option_merge's ``Addon`` functionality. Instead of depending on
input_algorithms itself we just have a bare bones fake implementation of it instead.

This fake version is installed into your virtualenv automatically if you run
``test.sh``.
